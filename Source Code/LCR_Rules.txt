Rules:

Left Center Right (LCR) is a multiplayer dice game with a minimum of three players, but no upper limit
on the number of participants. The goal is to win all of the chips.

~The Dice~
+ There are three dice rolled each turn. Each die has the letters L, C, and R on it along with dots on
  the remaining three sides. These dice determine where the player's chips will go.
    -- For each L, the player must pass one chip to the player sitting to the left.
    -- For each R, the player must pass one chip to the player sitting to the right.
    -- For each C, the player must place one chip into the chenter pot and those chips are now out of
       play.
    -- Dots are neutral and require no action to be taken for that die.

~The Chips~
+ Each player will start with three chips.
+ If a player only has one chip, he/she/they only rolls one die. If a player has two chips left,
  he/she/they rolls two dice. Once a player is out of chips, he/she/they are still in the game (as
  he/she/they may get chips passed to him/her/them), but passes the dice to the next player.

~Winning the Game~
+ The winner is the last player with chips.
